### Probability Practice

1. Let's say we play a game where I keep flipping a coin until I get heads. If the first time I get heads is on the nth coin, then I pay you 2n-1 dollars. How much would you pay me to play this game?

    You should end up with a sequence that you need to find the closed form of. If you don't know how to do this, write some python code that sums the first 100.

2. Write a program to simulate the game and verify that your answer is correct.
