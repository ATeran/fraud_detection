![](img/ml-pipeline)

* but we all know that data science is not ml.

for the next three days we will deal with the entire end to end pipeline of data science through a case study.  We have touched on aspects of this throughout the course but have not yet put all the pieces together.

We will also touch on some new topics including:
* cloud services including AWS
* web applications (and the technology of the web)
* deploying a DS application
* a touch of data visualization/presentation


#### Themes (you be be assessed on this)

* Software best practices (proper encapsulation and functions)
* product focus
* deploy models
* project scoping -- independence

#### Rough timeline 

* Wed.: Project scoping and Model building
* Thursday: Web app and deployment
* Fri.: presentation -- slideshow and data viz

#### Deliverables

* model (properly commented and encapsulated on Github with a README)
* exposed API
* 3 min. presentation
* Data visualization (extra)

#### Assessment

* You will be assessed both on quality and cleanliness of code
* as well as a well functioning solution
